# Project Summary

In this project we will create an application that can change the theme of a paragraph real-time using elements on the front-end. We will also create a switch that can enable and disable the ability to change the theme of the paragraph. In the process of creating this project, we will cover how to use `this`, `bind`, `state`, and `props`.
